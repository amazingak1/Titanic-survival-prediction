## Dataset

The project uses the famous Titanic dataset, which includes the following features:

| Feature   | Description                                     |
|-----------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Survival  | Survival (0 = No, 1 = Yes)                      |
| Pclass    | Ticket class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)       |
| Sex       | Gender                                          |
| Age       | Age in years                                    |
| SibSp     | Number of siblings/spouses aboard               |
| Parch     | Number of parents/children aboard               |
| Fare      | Passenger fare                                  |
| Embarked  | Port of embarkation (C, Q, S)                  |
